# Sub: Solving 8-queens problem using uniform cost search.

States: Any arrangement of 0-8 queens on the board (1 queen per column) such that no queen attacks another.  
                                          
Initial State: No queens on the board.

Successor Function: Add a queen to an empty field on the board such that it is not attacked by any other queen.

Search space: chess board with n or fewer queens, each on a different square.

Goal test: A state is the goal if it has exactly n queens and no queen is attacking any other queen.

Path cost: 0 (we are only interested in the solution).
